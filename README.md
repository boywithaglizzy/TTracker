# Tenant Tracker

Robberies and scams brought about by people impersonating utility workers have been a serious issue, especially for tenants who are temporarily renting housing. Right now a convenient and free way for landlords and tenants to communicate does not exist. This lack of communication has led to tenants being easily susceptible to scams and robberies from people claiming to be utility workers. 
Tenant Tracker, a web application that bridges the communication gap between landlords and their tenants, is designed to significantly prevent scams and robberies that are caused by common miscommunications. The application provides ways for tenants and landlords to submit repair requests, communicate payment statuses, and more. Unlike other applications, this solution communicates repair information, home visits, rent payment, and status of appliances in one easy to use space. 

## List of features
Tenant Tracker will introduce effective communication to landlords and tenants. Landlords will be able to enter their properties into Tenant Tracker, including any appliances and their condition. When a tenant is renting the property, they will be able to notify the landlord of any necessary repairs. Landlords can then notify their tenants of a scheduled repair time and the name of the repair company. Tenants will also be able to communicate the status of their rent payment to their landlord. Landlords will be able to setup automated notification of missed or late payments, as well as other notices, including entry of the properly.
